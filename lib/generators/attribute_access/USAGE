Description:
    Add attribute access control to an ActiveRecord model

Example:
    rails generate attribute_access Thing

    This will create a migration thats adds 
    :read_only_attributes to your Thing model
        
    You will then need to add
    
        include AttributeAccessControllable
    
    to your model to enable the new behavior
